Description: Limitless (VIP) is a digital currency created by a
 trusted group of developers in early February 2014. The future of
 Limitless is helping to make Breast Cancer a thing of the past
 but the main activity of Limitless is to be the exclusive
 currency for Limitless Island, a vision that the Team are working
 towards. The Limitless technology enables instant payments to
 anyone, anywhere in the world, however, the main real world use for
 VIP will be for goods and services on Limitless island. Bitcoin led
 the way with this technology and was first released in November
 2008, a paper was posted on the internet under the name Satoshi
 Nakamoto uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central
 authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out
 collectively by the network. Limitless Core is the name of open
 source software which enables the use of VIP the currency.
