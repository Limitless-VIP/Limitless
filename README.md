TittieCoin Core - About
=====================================

What is TittieCoin?
----------------

TittieCoin (TTC) is an experimental digital currency created by a trusted group of
developers early Febuary 2014. TTC is currently being developed to be
the exclusive currency for Tittie Island, a vision that we are working towards.
The TTC technology enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world, however,
the main real world use for TittieCoin will be for goods and services on Tittie island. 
Bitcoin led the way with this technology and was first released In November 2008,
a paper was posted on the internet under the name Satoshi Nakamotouses peer-to-peer
technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing
money are carried out collectively by the network. TittieCoin Core is the name of
open source software which enables the use of TTC the currency. 

TittieCoin v2.0 development was inspired by the the PIVX model, a fork of PIVX with a few changes
differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, 
different hashing algorithm phi1612, and a slightly modified GUI.
TittieCoin also proudly boasts Dark Gravity Wave 3 an open source difficulty-adjusting algorithm
for Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies that was first used in Darkcoin/Dash and has sice
been adopted by other digital currencies.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the TittieCoin Core software, see https://tittiecoin.com/, or read the
