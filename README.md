Limitless Core - About
=====================================

What is Limitless VIP?
----------------

Limitless (VIP) is a digital currency created by a trusted group of developers in
early February 2014. The future of Limitless VIP is helping to make Breast Cancer
a thing of the past but the main activity of Limitless VIP is to be the exclusive 
currency for Limitless Island, a vision that the Team are working towards.
The Limitless technology enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world, however,
the main real world use for VIP will be for goods and services on Limitless island. 
Bitcoin led the way with this technology and was first released in November 2008,
a paper was posted on the internet under the name Satoshi Nakamoto uses peer-to-peer
technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing
money are carried out collectively by the network. Limitless Core is the name of
open source software which enables the use of VIP the currency. 

Limitless v4.0 development was inspired by the PIVX model, a fork of PIVX with a few changes
differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, 
different hashing algorithm phi1612, and a slightly modified GUI.
Limitless also proudly boasts Dark Gravity Wave 3 an open source difficulty-adjusting algorithm
for Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies that was first used in Darkcoin/Dash and has since
been adopted by other digital currencies.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Limitless Core software, see https://limitlessvip.co.za, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://limitlessvip.co.za/public/Limitless_VIP_White_Paper.pdf).
